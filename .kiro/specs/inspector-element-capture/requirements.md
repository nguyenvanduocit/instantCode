# Requirements Document

## Introduction
This feature enables automatic image capture of selected elements during AI interactions, providing visual context to help the AI understand which specific elements are being discussed. Images are saved locally and referenced in messages to enhance AI comprehension.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Element Image Capture
**Objective:** As a developer, I want the inspector to automatically capture images of selected elements when sending messages to AI, so that the AI has visual context for more accurate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user selects an element in the inspector THEN the Inspector SHALL capture a screenshot of that element
2. WHEN capturing an element screenshot THEN the Inspector SHALL save the image to a tmp directory under the project working directory
3. WHEN saving an element image THEN the Inspector SHALL generate a unique filename that identifies the specific element

### Requirement 2: Image Path Integration
**Objective:** As a developer, I want image paths automatically included in AI messages, so that the AI can reference the visual context when providing responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN sending a message to AI THEN the Inspector SHALL include the captured image path in the message
2. WHEN including image paths THEN the Inspector SHALL use descriptive filenames that help AI understand which image corresponds to which element
3. WHEN multiple elements are selected THEN the Inspector SHALL include all relevant image paths in the message

### Requirement 3: File Management
**Objective:** As a developer, I want captured images organized and uniquely named, so that multiple captures don't conflict and images can be easily identified.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating image files THEN the Inspector SHALL ensure each filename is unique to prevent overwrites
2. WHEN saving images THEN the Inspector SHALL organize them in a tmp directory structure under the project root
3. WHEN generating filenames THEN the Inspector SHALL include element identifiers or descriptive information in the filename
